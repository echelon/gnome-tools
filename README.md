I'll probably hack on some gnome tools at some point.

Tools
------
* **wallpaper.py** - random wallpaper script, but notably reads from the 
  `~/.gnome2/background.xml` config file to determine available files and
  their user-set options. This allows user to manage zoom style, etc. 
  from under the Appearance Preferences applet/dialog.
